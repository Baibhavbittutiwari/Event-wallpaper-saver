# Event Wallpaper Script README

## Description
The Event Wallpaper script is a Python application designed to set the desktop wallpaper based on events fetched from a CSV file and corresponding images obtained from the Unsplash API. The script allows users to personalize their desktop background according to scheduled events, providing a dynamic and visually appealing experience.

## Features
- **Event Management**: Reads events from a CSV file and retrieves the event scheduled for the current date.
- **Image Search**: Searches for images related to the current event on the Unsplash platform.
- **Image Download**: Downloads the selected image and saves it locally for wallpaper setting.
- **Wallpaper Setting**: Sets the downloaded image as the desktop wallpaper using the ctypes library on Windows.

## File Structure
The script consists of the following files:
- **event_wallpaper.py**: The main Python script containing the EventWallpaper class and the main function.
- **All_events.csv**: A CSV file containing the list of events organized by date.

## Dependencies
The script requires the following Python libraries:
- `os`: For operating system-related operations.
- `ctypes`: Windows-specific module for system operations.
- `requests`: HTTP requests library for fetching data from the Unsplash API.
- `pandas`: Data manipulation library for handling CSV files.
- `datetime`: Module for working with dates and times.

## Usage
1. **Setup**: Ensure that the required Python libraries are installed. Optionally, obtain an API key from Unsplash .
2. **CSV File Preparation**: Populate the `All_events.csv` file with events organized by date. Each row contain the date of the event and a description of the event.
3. **Execution**: Run the `event_wallpaper.py` script. Follow the prompts to the Unsplash API client ID when prompted.
4. **Desktop Wallpaper Update**: The script will fetch the event for the current date, search for related images on Unsplash, download the image, and set it as the desktop wallpaper.

## Notes
- Ensure that the CSV file remains well-formatted with proper column headers and data integrity to avoid issues with data processing and integration.
- Backup the CSV file regularly to prevent data loss in case of accidental deletion or corruption.

## Future Improvements
- Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and provide informative error messages to the user.
- Explore the possibility of making the script more platform-independent to support operating systems other than Windows.
- Enhance user interaction by providing options for customizing wallpaper settings, such as image resolution and display mode.
